# Just Radio iOS App

Just Radio is a fun experimental app to make finding and listening to radio stations on iOS a pleasant experience. Too many radio apps are stuffed full of obtrusive advertising, or have become so big that finding and playing a station is cumbersome.

I don't expect this to get into the app store since it uses the private TuneIn/RadioTime API, but it's here for anyone to try out, clone, and build on.
